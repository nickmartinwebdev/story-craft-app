## üé® Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Components

#### 1. **TypingIndicator** with Mantine Transitions
```typescript
// Uses Mantine's Transition component instead of CSS keyframes
<Transition
  mounted={visibleDots[index]}
  transition="fade"
  duration={200}
  timingFunction="ease-out"
>
  {(styles) => (
    <Box style={{
      ...styles,
      transform: visibleDots[index] 
        ? "translateY(-2px) scale(1.1)" 
        : "translateY(0) scale(1)",
      transition: "transform 0.2s ease-out",
    }} />
  )}
</Transition>
```

#### 2. **Intelligent Response Generation**
```typescript
const detectContext = () => {
  const contexts = {
    budget: ["budget", "cost", "money", "funding", "roi"],
    timeline: ["timeline", "schedule", "deadline", "milestone"],
    // ... 8 total contexts with keyword matching
  };
  
  // Smart scoring algorithm
  const scores = {};
  Object.keys(contexts).forEach(context => {
    scores[context] = contexts[context]
      .filter(keyword => input.includes(keyword)).length;
  });
  
  return Object.entries(scores)
    .reduce((a, b) => scores[a[0]] > scores[b[0]] ? a : b)[0];
};
```

#### 3. **Context7-Inspired Response Framework**
Each response includes:
- **Structured Format**: Clear sections with emojis and markdown
- **Actionable Frameworks**: Step-by-step methodologies
- **Follow-up Questions**: Guides conversation deeper
- **Best Practices**: Industry-proven approaches

### Animation System

#### Message Animations
```typescript
<Transition
  mounted={true}
  transition="slide-up"
  duration={300}
  timingFunction="ease"
  keepMounted={false}
>
  {(styles) => (
    <Group style={{
      ...styles,
      animationDelay: `${index * 50}ms`,
    }}>
      {/* Message content */}
    </Group>
  )}
</Transition>
```

#### Typing Indicator Sequence
- **Staggered Appearance**: Dots appear with 200ms delays
- **Hold Period**: 800ms display time
- **Reverse Fade**: Fade out in reverse order
